<h1>Alias</h1>
<p>
You can select a unique Alias name (Identifier), which will appear in the column headers of the exporting files (MS Excel&reg;)
once you have analysed your results. The Alias will assist you in doing your analysis through further statistical programmes,
e.g. Statistica, SSPS, etc. If you do not select an Alias the column headers will contain ID numbers of the individual
questions (e.g. Question ID 45678), but no unique identifiers that can remind you of the overall theme of the question
(e.g. Satisfaction).
