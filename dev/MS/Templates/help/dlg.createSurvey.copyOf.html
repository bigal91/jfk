<h1>Create a Copy of?</h1>
<p>
	Instead of creating an entirely new questionnaire design you can also select to create a copy of an existing survey/template. 
</p>
<p>
This function can save you a lot of time in that you don't need to entirely create a new questionnaire design, but can build on an existing one. 
</p>
<h1>Don't want to create a copy?</h1>
<p>
If you don't want to create a copy you are able to not select any existing questionnaire design and the programme will provide you with an empty questionnaire design to be filled.
