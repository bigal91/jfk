<h1>Include Participants of?</h1>
<p>
Instead of always creating a new participant list for each survey, you may also include the participants of previously existing surveys in your new survey.  
</p>
<p>
This function can save you time in that you can interview existing participant lists with a variety of survey designs.  
</p>
<h1>Don't want to include existing Participants?</h1>
<p>
If you don't want to include participants from other surveys you are able to not select any participants and just create a new list once the design has been established.
