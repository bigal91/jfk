<h1>What type to select?</h1>
<p>
When you create a Survey you can select between either creating a Survey, a Template or a Public Template. 
</p>
<h2>Creating a Survey</h2>
<p>
	will enable you to design and release a Survey. You will however not be able to modify the created questionnaire design anymore at a later stage.
</p> 
<p>
Creating a Survey is thus only recommended, when you either want to use this questionnaire design for one specific survey only or you want to release a survey based on an existing questionnaire design that you will not want to adapt anymore. 
</p>
<h2>Creating a Template</h2>
<p>will enable you to design a questionnaire Template which can be utilised for a variety of surveys. You will be able to modify the design at any point in time.
